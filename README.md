# Who Let the Logs Out
![logo](web/themes/custom/wholetthelogsout/images/wholetthelogsout_logo_90px.png)

This project is inspired by the [Loggable](https://github.com/mikestefanello/loggable)
project.

> Loggable is a comprehensive, centralized solution for administrative
event logging and alerting; providing both a back and front-end.
> Easily store, view, filter and manage your admin events across all of
> your channels in a single place; whether you need to add logging
> capabilities to a single application or you're looking to save time
> and resources by centralizing your admin log management.
>
> Loggable also provides rule-based alerts so you can be notified when
> events are logged that meet the exact criteria that you specify. This
> allows you to decide who gets notified, for which events, and how.
> Notification options include email, Slack, and webhooks. Additional
> integrations cab easily be added.
>
> Loggable can be used in isolation for your organization, or using the
> included module, made in to a SaaS, along with subscription-based
> billing via Stripe.com.
>
> Built with Drupal 8.

Who Let the Logs Out, built with Drupal 10, wants to be more
modern, more complete and more personalized.

This tool is for beginners and pros alike.
Its use is recommended only for non-PROD environments and is
mainly intended for developers and QA.

## Installation
Being a Drupal 10 distribution, this can be installed the same way you
would any Drupal site.

The easiest way to install is using [Docksal](https://docksal.io/).
Once you have Docksal installed on your computer, from within
the root of this repo, execute `fin init`. Once the installation is complete,
navigate to `wholetthelogsout.docksal.site/` in your browser and login using `admin:admin`.
